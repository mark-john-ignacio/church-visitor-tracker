Additional Feature: Company User License Limits (Not implemented yet)

Each Company can have a license limit (e.g., allowed 5 users, 10 users, etc.).

When an admin tries to invite or create a new user:

The system checks if the current number of users is below the license limit.

If they reached the limit, prevent creation and show a friendly error like:
âž” "User limit reached for your plan. Please upgrade your subscription."
