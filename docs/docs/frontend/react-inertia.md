# React with Inertia.js

MyXFinâ€™s frontend is built with React and Inertia.js, powered by Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components.

Key points:

- **Inertia pages:** Create React pages under `resources/js/Pages` with default export of components.
- **Layouts:** Use the shared layout in `resources/js/Layouts/AppLayout.tsx` for consistent styling.
- **UI Components:** ShadCN UI & Tailwind provide reusable styled components. See `src/components` for custom examples.
- **Routing:** Define routes in `routes/web.php` pointing to Inertia controllers.

Refer to:

- `resources/js/Pages` directory
- `app/Http/Controllers` for Inertia controllers
- `src/components` for Storybook usage
