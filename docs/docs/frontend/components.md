# Frontend Components

MyXFin uses a mix of ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, and custom React components showcased in Storybook.

Key points:

- **Storybook:** Run Storybook locally at `http://localhost:6006` to browse component library.
- **Component source:** All UI components live under `stories` and `src/components`.
- **Custom styling:** Extend Tailwind via `tailwind.config.js` and use ShadCN primitives for unstyled components.
- **Naming conventions:** Component files use PascalCase, and story files follow `<Component>.stories.tsx`.

Refer to:

- `tailwind.config.js`
- `stories` folder
- `src/components` folder
